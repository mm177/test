  <h1>The Changing Face of the Humanities in the Digital World</h1>  
  Academics are experiencing a constantly shifting progression in the modern world, adopting all kinds of alternate routes and methods in order to consistently progress and keep up with the times. In a world where it is dangerously easy for academic fields to fall flat or lose their relevance in the eyes of those 
  not specifically focused on those studies, this has never been more necessary than it is today. Society has progressed
   to a point where the humanities in particular are falling more and more to the wayside with every new development,
    which has prompted measures to be taken in order to secure their place in the world of academia, maintaining relevance 
    even in modern times. At the forefront of these methods is the movement of digital humanities, which has gained prominence
     in recent years as options have been revised in an effort to preserve the humanities. 


     
     Kathleen Fitzpatrick, in her article titled “The Humanities, Done Digitally” defines this phenomena most simply as, “a nexus of fields
      within which scholars use computing technologies to investigate the kinds of questions that are traditional 
      to the humanities” (Fitzpatrick 2011). Matthew Kirschenbaum, in his own article “What is Digital Humanities
       and What's It Doing In English Departments?” defines the movement as, “At its core, then, digital humanities
        is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even
         technologies” (Kirschenbaum 2010). Basically, the digital humanities opens a door of new opportunities for
          research, literary criticism, analysis, archiving, and a myriad of other tasks that have previously been 
          left up to manual work to complete. Combining the content of humanities and the resources of STEM fields,
           this movement is twofold in its purpose: efficiency and an increase in objectivity when reviewing and
            analyzing literature. 


            The question then presents itself: should an exchange of power be made in the world of humanities, as the modern age
             continues to plow forward and this particular field remains in one place? Should objectivity and revitalization be
              prioritized over the creative process and critical thinking skills, and is the exchange comparable? As some of the
               most relevant questions in this day and age of humanities, there may be too many moving parts to come to a
                conclusive decision on the value of the digital world being mixed in. However, the options can still be weighed
                 against one another in order to balance the pros and cons, and ultimately determine whether the exchange is
                  beneficial to humanities at this point in time.

                  Speaking about Johnathan Gottschall, literary scholar at Washington and Jefferson College in Pennsylvania,
                   Luke Dorhmehl writes in an article titled "Should We Teach Literature Students How To Analyze Texts
                    Algorithmically”, “Gottschall says that he was prompted to embrace the digital humanities by ‘frustration
                     and near despair with the way academic literary studies within the humanities were conducting themselves.’
                      In particular, he points to literary studies’ inability (or refusal) to ever get closer to an objective
                       truth–with their being, he claims, little accumulation of knowledge from generation to generation which
                        meaningfully builds on the work of predecessors, without trying to shoot them down first” (Dorhmehl 2013).
                         The search for objectivity seems to primarily fuel the purpose behind this use of algorithmic literary
                          analysis, since oftentimes analyzers look to the sciences to try and find a secure answer to their
                           questions, even if the fields might not usually mix in most contexts. In the situation of literature
                            and literary theory, there is obviously quite a bit of subjectivity of opinions and conclusions that
                             are drawn. To combat this, therefore, this type of analysis comes into play in order to search for
                              some solid evidence and conclusions that otherwise might not be reached via “regular” analysis.
                               Removing the human element (which can, admittedly, lead into some run-ins with critical thinking
                                issues in the long term, as discussed more in depth later on) can eliminate that subjectivity
                                 entirely, assuming the programs used to complete the analytical tasks have been constructed on
                                  objective terms with no agenda toward a specific viewpoint in mind. 

                                  Computations can be, of course, programmed to produce a certain result, and there is always
                                   a chance that this could occur, but if scholars are searching for objectivity in their research 
                                   through digital methods, caution would be taken to ensure that this issue would not come about. 
    One issue, however, that should be brought into consideration for this movement, is how the creative process, as well as critical
     thinking, might be diluted along the way, once scientific algorithmic processes take over the individual methods of divining 
     answers from literature. After all, once a primarily computed method is substituted for active analysis by individuals is put in place,
      there are obvious repercussions. Not only could it be argued that the creativity and ability to value multiple viewpoints is jeopardized,
       but also the chance to develop lines of thinking regarding the literature itself. Trevor Owens, writing for the Library of Congress,
        in a quote compiled within Matthew K. Gold’s book Debates in the Digital Humanities, says, “DH is at its best when it embraces the digital
         not simply as a means to the traditional ends of scholarship, but when it transforms the nature of what humanists do. The digital allows 
         for scholars, librarians, archivists, and curators to engage much more directly with each other and the public. Further, it allows them not 
         simply to write for each other, but to build things for everyone” (Owens 2011). That final line is incredibly telling; it hints at the mass production quality of content that could be produced under the umbrella of digital humanities. In the search for objectivity, the human element of the humanities might become so far removed that it almost commercializes the subsequent material that is put out into the world. Though the attempt to reach the widest audience through an impartial analysis and research process conducted via digital methods, the authenticity of the research itself might become diluted in the process.

         By and large, in the pursuit of revitalizing the method in which we study literature and the humanities as a whole, might result in unforeseen consequences of further diminishing that already endangered spark of interest. There are valid points made by those who sense a decrease in the enthusiasm toward literary analysis and the like; however, it is impossible to ignore the unanswered question that looms over this claim: how long could a computed version of that analysis be sustainably able to rekindle that drive? Obviously, these analysts are speaking beyond the purely emotional level of how analysis is viewed; they understand that the world is ever-changing and norms shift dramatically, and therefore analyses and the like should have the fluidity to do so as well. This will contribute to efficiency and turnaround rates for producing analyses and delving into literary theories that have gone slack in recent years, but it does not take into account the fact that there will inherently be a disconnect between the previously necessary critical thinking skills and the texts themselves, as that will be substituted with computation and algorithms. Obviously, the primary goal of this shift is to keep the humanities up to the times and to reboot the relevancy of these studies in the modern world. Dorhmehl adds in his article, “Gottschall believes that these problems (the humanities’ increasing irrelevance, decreasing popularity, and the subjects’ inability to ever answer questions conclusively) are not only connected, but can be solved by implementing…data mining tools and computational textual analysis”. Hoping to kill multiple birds with one stone, these humanities scholars are attempting to make the jump into the world of sciences in order to answer seemingly impossible subjective questions that have ground these studies to a halt in more recent years. Omaha professor of English and researcher of digital humanities Stephen Ramsay, in his book Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism, argues, “The rigid calculus of computation, which knows nothing about the nature what it’s examining, can shock us out of our preconceived notions on a particular subject. When we read, we do so with all kinds of biases. Algorithms have none of those. Because of that they can take us off our rails and make us say, ‘A-ha! I’d never noticed that before’” (Ramsay 2011). There is, then, a case to be made for this transition, but consideration of the dangers cannot be cast aside.

         
         In order to come to a conclusive viewpoint on the impact of this shift in the humanities, of course, one has to take a look at the actual process involved. As a basic explanation, this concept is carried out by establishing an algorithm to determine certain aspects of a piece or writing or literature, which are recorded and from which conclusions are drawn. For example, a study was done to compare the expense of vocabulary used by authors Sinclair Lewis and William Faulkner, and it was discovered that Lewis had a vocabulary at least twice as extensive as Faulkner in his writings, although the latter is notorious for being difficult to read and analyze, while the former is often viewed as not producing writing of immense literary value (or at least, not possessing a significant style). Following patterns, vocabulary, comparisons of other writings, and so forth all come into play in this algorithmic process, which helps provide that objective scientific eye in analyses. Research can also be conducted through the use of these algorithms and methods, solving long-unanswered questions regarding authorship, authenticity, and more in situations of literature specifically. And, of course, archiving becomes significantly easier with the rise of the digital age and the use of computers; having information stored in that method and easily accessible (not to mention easily archived in the first place, when it no longer has to be done manually). The most obvious example of this is libraries and databases, where thousands of resources can be compiled into one place and available for the public to have on hand. With computers being able to maintain a system of organization, and a reliable methodology that results in convenience and opportunity for those it serves, these resources become available and accessible to a much wider variety of individuals than before, and allows the general public to enjoy these resources for their own learning and academic benefits.


         Obviously, there are many ways in which the digital humanities can create relevant change through its practice and implementation, but for the sake of this particular subject, rather than creating an exhaustive list, only a few examples have been observed; research on the methods is not as forefront to this thesis as the concepts behind it are. Rafael C. Alvarado said it best in his article titled “The Digital Humanities Situation” when he summed up this idea by stating, “…there is no definition of digital humanities, if by definition we mean a consistent set of theoretical concerns and research methods that might be aligned with a given discipline, whether one of the established fields or an emerging, transdisciplinary one” (Alvarado 2012). Being a fairly new movement, it can sometimes be difficult to pinpoint the specifics of how digital humanities functions, and how it has affected the field of humanities up to this point. Regardless, as mentioned previously, a complete list of the digital humanities’ methods is not necessary for the entirety of this discussion. Instead, the focus should turn to an important question that must be readdressed, in light of the other compiled information that has been stated. How long can the humanities sustainably make the shift to the digital world, and ride off the metaphorical high of this change, before slipping back into obscurity? Looking into this concept in more depth, a secondary question also presents itself: is it the method through which humanities scholars go about their work that has pushed it to the wayside in our world today, or is it the content of the subjects themselves? One might be tempted, in an effort to shield the humanities from criticism, to suggest the former. It is easier to let the blame fall to those carrying out the tasks rather than the core of the actual subjects that are being worked upon, but the question does need consideration in order to address the sustainability of the humanities in the digital world. While it would be difficult to make a decision in either way without substantial evidence to back up the claims, it can safely be said that a combination of the two has contributed to this lack of interest in the field. Literary analysis is notorious among non-scholars for being difficult to academically and intellectually access, and it as seen among more recent generations as an exclusionary field that is reserved for those with a store of preexisting knowledge on the topics. In this way, it has become somewhat inaccessible over time, and the “elite” aspect of the humanities might be slipping dangerously into “exclusionary” territory. In a way, because of how it is carried out, the humanities might be orchestrating its own destruction.


         If this is the case, then digital humanities is not only an important option to be considered, but it is nearly imperative if scholars in the humanities wish for the content to maintain a semblance of relevance. However, there is another option that might actually downplay the necessity of digital humanities, and might imply that humanities as a whole cannot necessarily be rescued from its inevitable loss of interest in the upcoming future. This suggestion is that the actual content of the studied material is no longer relevant or of interest to readers, rising scholars, and audiences today. Quite simply, the material itself has gone stale, in the sense that there is no practical use for the information offered, and therefore is viewed as obsolete. In such a fast-paced and task-oriented world, subjects such as literary analysis, archiving and historical research, translations, and so on, are no longer regarded as valuable content on which focus should be put. There are, in other words, “better things” to turn to, things that people deem to hold more relevance in their lives, and whether or not they are correct in that assumption, the result of their actions is the same: a decrease in interest towards the humanities. If this happens to be the case that scholars are being made to face in this present age, and undoubtedly in the future as well, then it is unclear whether digitalization of the work being done will contribute anything important to this attempt, or if it will only prolong the field’s relevance fo a little while longer. Is there still any degree of merit in focusing on literary and artistic analysis and research? Or has it become outdated to the extent of grinding to a complete halt, with little to no hope of gaining momentum to start back up again? Of course, scholars would say that there is always more to learn in the world of humanities, literature, and the arts. While they are accurate in that statement, however, it still remains debatable on whether or not that learned information bears any relevance to anyone outside of the scholars themselves.


         This is a necessary point to consider while speculating about these subjects in the long term, or for scholars whose work will be directly affected by the changes made with the rise of the digital humanities movement, but for the sake of this particular analysis, it will not be taken too deeply into considerations. More than anything, it is simply a contribution to the lineup of pros and cons, as well as productivity notes, on the overall concept. But returning to the matter most primarily at hand, there is another element to be addressed. In the confluence of the STEM field and humanities, another effort could conceivably be made to revitalize the practices and gain a wider range of interest. It is possible that the employment of resources used in the sciences and math fields could lead to an increased level of interest among those scholars as well, and while they would of course not give up their own line of work to join the ranks of the humanities academics, there is a chance that the climate created with that communal focus on the humanities (though, perhaps, a combination of traditional and digital means) could spark a resurgence in a new generation of scholars to engage in work within the field of humanities. In other words, with a wider spectrum of individuals involved in putting their time, thoughts, and resources toward expanding the humanities, it makes logical sense that there would be an increased interest rate with more exposure being given to the field. Morris Eaves, coauthor of the MLA report and quoted in the article “The Resistance to Digital Humanities” by David Greetham, stated once in an email correspondence, “When it comes to DH/resistance: resistance certainly remains, but it’s hard to gauge its character—maybe chiefly because things happen so slowly, or should I say gradually, or even carefully, in the humanities. One (I) would hope that DH would simply be digested like a rat in a python—slowly but inexorably. But there are some signs, as you say, of uphill battles with faculties and administrations fighting what I regard as rearguard battles—against whatever “digital” means, against statistics, etc. It seems to me that there’s a lot of “mere” prejudice involved—kneejerk “humanism,” complete with eyerolling, inattention to detail, refusal to listen, and so on…However, there are plenty of hopeful signs for us optimists…A certain level of resignation that, well, this digital stuff is happening, and we can resist only so much. A vast amount of sheer interest among Ph.D. students and recent Ph.Ds, cluster hires, the spread of digital humanities centers/institutes with a variety of missions, more and more Ph.D. candidates with serious investments in some flavor of DH” (Eaves 2011).
  
With this in mind, it would be interesting to consider how this theoretical new generation would approach the humanities in the modern age; would it be an expansion and continuation of the digital humanities; or, once the purpose of that method had been served, would it revert back to its original state of manual work? It is impossible to predict how such a situation would play out, but it is important to consider within the context of this thesis. In this conceptual version of a future reality, would objectivity in literary analysis and research be the absolute standard of the humanities, since it could be enacted on an entirely digital level? And if that were the case, would there be any semblance of original analysis by the individual researchers, or would that work have been transferred entirely to the machines to compute via algorithms? Again, there is no way to arrive at a conclusive certainty in this scenario, as it is entirely hypothetical, and would be completely dependent on the variables laid out previously, but even hypotheticals can reveal truths about the underlying nature of a process or scenario, especially by looking further down the road. In fact, there is evidence that the humanities is already slipping into that reality, slowly enough so that it has not necessarily been fully realized yet, but surely. William Pannapacker writes in a blog post titled “Digital Humanities Triumphant?”, “At this point, the digital humanities are 'the thing.’ There’s no ‘next’ about it. And it won’t be long until the digital humanities are, quite simply, ‘the humanities’” (Pannapacker 2012). If his statement is to be believed (and it is impossible to dispute that the digital world has permeated the preexisting world of the humanities, not enough at this point to consider all humanities to fall into the digital category, but certainly on the track to doing so), then a future like the one proposed above is not really so far-fetched after all. Of course, the situation proposed definitely employs the thought process of a snowball effect, but it still bears consideration. If digital humanities was able to remain sustainable all the way into a new generation of scholars, it is fully possible that by that time, the work would have been transferred a hundred percent into digital computations. Analysis, archiving, research, and all other methods that go into the work behind the product of humanities scholars’ time and effort, would be condensed into the computer work that could be carried out via algorithm.


This logically comes full circle back to the idea of impartiality and objectivity which, as has been shown, is the true heart of this overall concept. Efficiency is important, of course, but objectivity is the main piece of the puzzle that can be used to most enthusiastically promote the rejuvenation of the humanities. Offering a previously-impossible concept to be added into the mix is an enticing thought, and could boost morale in what seems to be a declining field. Tom Scheinfeldt, in his blog post titled “Sunset for Ideology, Sunrise for Methodology?” discusses this topic in less broad terms, articulating one of the most important fundamental characteristics of the digital humanities when he writes, “I believe we are at a similar moment of change right now that we are entering a new phase of scholarship that will be dominated not by ideas but once again by organizing activities, in terms of both organizing knowledge and organizing ourselves and our work. My difficulty in answering the question, ‘What’s the big idea in history right now?’ stems from the fact that, as a digital historian, I traffic much less in new theories than in new methods” (Scheinfeldt 2008). Being able to take common and often-used concepts, and examine them in ways that have previously been inaccessible or simply impossible, is an effective and beneficial way to stir interest back up in humanities as a whole. 


By and large, it becomes clear that the digital humanities is still such a fairly new and developing concept that it is difficult to determine if it will be wholly beneficial or not in the long term future. There is a myriad of reasons which detail the variety of benefits that would result from its continued implementation in the world of humanities, and there are multiple reasons explaining why this could ultimately cause major issues in the norms of research and scholarly application of ideas. While it mainly remains to be seen, there is one truth that must be addressed even if it does not add a viewpoint to the pros or the cons of this concept. For better or worse, the digital world has expanded to encompass nearly every aspect of society and the lives of individuals in recent years, integrating itself into culture, practices, and general norms to the point that we collectively rely on it not only for additional help, but for basics such as communication, information collection, promotions and representations, and expression of opinions. In this way, there is no doubt that the humanities will eventually be highly influenced by computations and the digital world (it already has been greatly influenced at this point in time, and considering the probably continuation of patterns, this will develop further as time goes by). Digitalization is widely regarded as a good and beneficial addition to society, and it seems that the only major reason that many scholars seem so hesitant to accept it as an aspect of the humanities is because of the changes it may cause to the fundamental structure of how this work is carried out. Vika Zafrin of Boston University, in a quote listed in the compilation “Day of DH: Defining the Digital Humanities” within the book Debates in the Digital Humanites by Matthew K. Gold, writes that digital humanities is, “…a metafield, a set of coevolving new knowledge and best practices expanding from traditional humanities disciplines into born-digital research and teaching methods” (Zafrin 2011). This union of the two worlds causes many to be wary, for all the reasons that have been previously discussed, but most especially because of the vague uncertainty of change. In a field that has remained largely the same throughout time, change is a daunting and sometimes frightening concept in the humanities. Compared to the fields that fall beneath STEM, which are constantly fluid with the times as new developments in science, math, and the like are continually being unearthed, the humanities might be seen as somewhat stagnant, aside from historical research that has been done on unearthing questions about literature and the arts. The introduction of digital humanities is a bit of a jarring event, however gently it might have been introduced. For a field notoriously resistant to change (especially change of the digital nature), embracing this new wave of culture and influence is a giant leap in the dark for many scholars. Many seem to view it as an all-or-nothing situation, in which the only options are to retain the traditional aspects of the humanities and all it entails and to ignore digital progressions entirely, or to allow the digital era to influence humanities to the extent that it might not even be classifiable as humanities anymore. However, this is not necessarily the case. Rather than setting an ultimatum to follow through on and either allow the humanities to diminish into nothing or change the face of the field forever, there are less extreme options that are much more reasonable and provide solutions for all involved parties, while allowing individuals to capitalize on the work they contribute.


Ultimately, the answer seems to lie within the overall idea of balance. Rather than having a field of study that is solely humanities stuck with antiquated and non-efficient methods of carrying out work, to the point of fading from the public eye and opinion altogether, and rather than having a system where the digital world commandeers every aspect of research and analysis, so that scholars no longer feel obligated to engage their own critical thinking skills, a happy medium can instead be struck in order to achieve a level of balance that results in the best scenario for everyone involved. Without a thesis that focuses specifically on action and direct examples of how this could specifically be carried out, this does admittedly seem like a broad and somewhat general statement; even a cop-out, to an extent. But truly, in a world where such a variety of opportunities present themselves at the fingertips of nearly anyone willing to grasp at them, a balance is more important than ever before. Utilizing the digital functions and computations that can contribute toward analyses, research, compilations and archives, while still maintaining a level of research that preserves the creative integrity and critical thinking skills of the scholars involved, would allow for a system in which the products of the humanities are produced effectively and in a fresh, much more modern way, without having to completely jeopardize what many consider to be the fundamental aspects of the humanities itself.
